\title{This function computes continuum removal value for a spectral band of interest,
based on lower and upper wavelengths corresponding to boundaries of the continuum}

\item{boundaries}{list. raster objects corresponding to minimum and maximum wavelengths}

\item{target}{list. raster object corresponding target wavelength}
}
\value{
CR list. raster object corresponding to continuum removed value
}

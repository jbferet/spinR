  repeats.allowed = FALSE,
  nbCPU = 1
)
}
\arguments{

\item{Spectral_Bands}{numeric. vector containing central wavelength for each spectral band of ReflMat}

\item{BPvars}{numeric. Biophysical properties as matrix with ncol = nBPvars and nrows = nsamples}

\item{ExpressIndex}{character. expression corresponding to the spectral index to be explored ()}

\item{repeats.allowed}{boolean. should combinations include repetitions? set false if SI expression is symmetrical to gain time}

\item{nbCPU}{numeric. number of CPU for multithreading}
}
\value{
list. includes band Combinations and corresponding correlation between biophysical variables and SI
